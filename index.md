### MQ Performance documents

This github repository will be used to publish MQ Performance documents from the MQ Performance Team based in Hursley, England.

For many years the traditional place for Performance reports has been the [IBM SupportPac](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007150) website. 

For new documents and performance articles, we intend to use this repository as the home for MQ Performance collateral.

### MQ Appliance
#### M2002

The M2002 MQ Appliance was released in July 2018, and the accompanying MQ Appliance Performance Report (MPA3) illustrates the increased performance of the new Hardware:
- M2002 Performance Report [MPA3.pdf](./MPA3.pdf)

#### M2001

The M2001 MQ Appliance was released in June 2016, and the accompanying MQ Appliance Performance Report (MPA1) and MQ Appliance HA and DR Performance Report (MPA2) have been updated to show the increased performance on the new Hardware:
- M2001 Performance Report [MPA1-2.0.pdf](./MPA1-2.0.pdf)
- ~~M2001 HA and DR Performance Report [MPA2-2.0.pdf](./MPA2-2.0.pdf)~~

The release of MQ 9.1 in July 2018, resulted in performance improvements in many HA and DR related scenarios on the M2001 appliance. The HA and DR Performance report has been updated again to Version 3:
- M2001 HA and DR Performance Report [MPA2-3.0.pdf](./MPA2-3.0.pdf)



#### M2000

The M2000 MQ Appliance was the original version of the MQ Appliance and the performance reports that relate to this model are available here:
- M2000 Performance Report [MPA1.pdf](./MPA1.pdf) 
- M2000 HA and DR Performance Report [MPA2.pdf](./MPA2.pdf) 

#### AMS

MQ V9 delivered a new AMS Quality of Protection called ‘Confidentiality’. A performance whitepaper has been produced that illustrates the performance profile this new mode brings by comparing it to existing AMS, TLS and non AMS scenarios. [AMSMQAppliance.pdf](./AMSMQAppliance.pdf)


### MQ Distributed

#### Best Practises for Performance
This document contains general sections on best practises for performance, formerly included in the performance reports (MQ V8 and earlier). It is now published as a seperate report.[MQ Performance Best Practises V1.0.1](./MQ_Performance_Best_Practices_v1.0.1.pdf)

#### Base MQ (V9.1 onwards)
Performance reports for MQ on distributed platforms from V9.1 onwards are available below.

[Queue Manager Restart Times.pdf](./Queue%20Manager%20Restart%20Times.pdf).

### MQ on OpenShift
MQ is now available as part of the Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) available on the OpenShift platform. Whitepapers exploring the performance of MQ in that environment will be published shortly. These will be consumable reports that investigate a particular scenario; choose the most appropriate report to assist you in your sizing process.

### MQ for z/OS

Performance reports for the latest versions of IBM MQ for z/OS are available here. 
- MQ for z/OS Capacity Planning and Tuning guide [MP16.pdf](./mp16.pdf). This report provides capacity planning and setup/tuning information for IBM MQ for z/OS version 9.1 and earlier releases. It describes how to define performance critical queue manager and channel initiator environment parameters. This version of the report includes a refresh of measurements for IBM z15 including the improvements to channels configured with COMPMSG(ZLIBFAST), plus updates to the TLS cipher costs and the usage of temporary dynamic queues.
- MQ for z/OS version 9.0 performance report [MP1K.pdf](./mp1k.pdf). The report discusses the performance of AMS, including the new AMS 'Confidentiality' Quality of Protection, using IBM MQ classes for JMS in both CICS OSGi JVM Server and IMS environments as well as page set statistics.
- MQ for z/OS version 9.1.0 performance report [MQ for zOS V910 Performance.pdf](./MQ%20for%20zOS%20V910%20Performance.pdf). The report discusses the performance characteristics of the MQ for z/OS V910 as well the performance improvements to AMS, support for Java clients on z/OS and Db2 Universal Table Space support.

#### MQ for z/OS - General white papers

Performance reports for MQ on z/OS documenting our experiences:

- How does MQ for z/OS perform when moving to z15? Paper [MQ for z/OS on z15](./MQ_for_zOS_on_z15.pdf) discusses the performance expectations and what we achieved when moving from z14 to z15. The paper also discusses some of the new features available on z15 that MQ is able to use, such as the on-chip compression accelerator and the Crypto Express 7S feature.
- How does MQ for z/OS perform when moving to z14? Paper [MQ for z/OS on z14](./MQ_for_zOS_on_z14_v1.2.pdf) discusses the performance expectations and what we achieved when moving from z13 to z14. The paper also discusses some of the new features available on z14 that MQ is able to use such as the Crypto Express 6S feature and the re-location of Storage Class Memory from CF Flash to Virtual Flash Memory. There is also an update to the impact of using zEDC compression with MQ archive logs.
- Performance of streamed persistent workload from z/OS using shared queue to Linux [QREP_Performance_MQ_zOS_to_Linux.pdf](./QREP_Performance_MQ_zOS_to_Linux.pdf). This paper discusses the shared queue configuration options when sending persistent messages to a Linux partner, illustrating differences in performance when the Linux partner uses client or bindings connections. The configuration used simulates a Queue Replication workload.

### FASP
The Fast, Adaptive and Secure Protocol (FASP®) is a high-speed transport that can achieve speeds much higher than TCP, especially across high latency and/or lossy networks. This capability is available through the fasp.io Gateway which MQ V9.1.4 advanced edition customers can download via Passport Advantage. Some initial results measured in the lab for servers channels connecting through a fasp.io Gateway can be seen in [this deck](./MQ914_fasp_gw.pdf). 
**!!18th Feb 2020 - Updated with compression measurements.**
